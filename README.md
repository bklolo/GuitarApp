# GuitarApp
This application displays the notes within a chosen key and scale on each individual guitar string, with a selected root, in order to experiment in different string tunings.

To practice Java, I'm creating a simple guitar app. This app will be for anyone that wants to visualize scales while they experiment 
with random tunings on the guitar.
