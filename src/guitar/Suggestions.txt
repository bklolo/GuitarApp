Hayden: Okay so you can start by creating an array of boolean the same size as your 
array of circles, you may assume that the indicies of each array match up so 

for int i.....
  boolean showCircle = showCircle[i];
  Circle circle = circles[i];
  if(showCircle)
    circle.draw();


[2:03 PM] Hayden: Or a better way would be to have a wrapper class for your circle 
object, and have a field that determines whether or not you should draw the circle
[2:04 PM] Hayden: so it would be something like


class CircleWrapper {
  //constructor
  Circle circle;
  boolean drawCircle;
  //getters
  //setters
}

if(circleWrapper.shouldDrawCircle()) {
  circleWrapper.getCircle().draw();
}
